To run this program, you will need to open and run all of the SQL files, creating the database, and its stored procedures. Sorry if there are a lot, weren't exactly sure how to do it.

After that, using the CSV files to input the menu information into the respective tables for Entree, Drinks, Sides, Apps and BanquetHalls is required. Other CSV files simply add some test data to mess around with.

The GUI does not update itself automatically and you will need to restart the GUI to see the changes made.

VsCode was being difficult with the username and password, so we manually put in these in most cases, so BEFORE YOU RUN THE PROGRAM, CRTL + F "Flint0711##" AND REPLACE IT WITH YOUR OWN VSCODE PASSWORD. Once again, apologies for the crude password hardcoding.

Once all is done, running the GUI file will prompt for SQL username and password, something that should probably avoid the step above, however, my father dropped me on my head as a child (True story) and I could not figure out what was wrong.
From there, it should be working and everything else will be straightforward.

Really had a nice semester and we enjoyed the class!
